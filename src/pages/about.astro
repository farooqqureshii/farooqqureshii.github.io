        Hi, I'm Farooq!
      </p>
      <p>
        I study <a href="https://www.uoee.rocks/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://uottawa.ca" target="_blank">The University of Ottawa</a>, and lead the team behind <a href="https://uOttaHack.ca" target="_blank">uOttaHack</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I teach competitive debating, <a href="/other/books" class="read-link">read</a> and <a href="/writing" class="hover:italic transition-all">write</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please feel free to say <a href="mailto:farooq.qureshi@outlook.com">hi</a>, see my <a href="https://github.com/farooqqureshii" target="_blank">code</a>, browse my <a href="https://curius.app/farooq-qureshi" target="_blank">interests</a>, or view my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/farooqq" target="_blank">experience</a>. Here's my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sM9b3G5AbRIG-kDz68KOzGxeETeKm8rN/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">résumé</a> too.
      </p>
      <p>
        In more detail, I was born in Karachi, Pakistan. I spent a small chunk of my childhood there, and then came to Canada where I lived in Toronto and then Calgary. Most of my education was done in Calgary. I moved to Ottawa in 2024.

        Academically, my current interests lie at the intersection between system analysis and signal processing. Namely, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover:italic transition-all">Fast Fourier Transform</a> (in particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rader%27s_FFT_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover:italic transition-all">Rader's Algorithm</a>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover:italic transition-all">Z-Transform</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_stability_criterion" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="hover:italic transition-all">Nyquist Stability Criterion</a>. Professionally, I'm interested in product and strategy. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Before University, I spent almost all of high school competitively debating, where I won at Stanford's Invitational and Harvard's Invitational Tournaments. I also participated in Model UN, where I competed at conferences across the nation, and also organized the largest high-school Model UN conference in Western Canada.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I now am lucky enough to coach some exceptionally bright students in both these areas. I've coached the winners of the Alberta Provincial Debating Championships, Canadian National Debating Championships, Harvard Invitationals & Yale Invitationals. 
      </p>

   A long-term aspiration of mine is to understand abstract art more. In the short-term, I'm trying to read more biographies. 
      
        The traits I admire the most are altruism and intellectual humility, a trait that I try to avoid is inflexibility. My favorite author is a tie between Ernest Hemingway and Prabda Yoon. Favorite book (changes far too often) but is currently To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf. Favorite movie is also a tie between Frances Ha and Green Book. Favorite <a href="/other/music" class="hover:italic transition-all">music</a> is from Jelani Aryeh or Vince Staples.

          I'm always extremely interested in talking about the above, or anything else. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:farooq.qureshi@outlook.com" class="hover:italic transition-all">email me, here</a>.
