Here are some things I believe in. Many of these thoughts I hope to later expand on independently. Of important note, is that these simply represent my beliefs based on a relatively short amount of lived experience. I imagine many of these will change as I move through university, let alone different stages of my life. Enjoy.

Be kind. 

Being result oriented means being input oriented. Good input rarely yields bad results. Conversely, bad inputs almost always yields bad results. Good is subjective here. Granted, it is much easier to define what a bad input is than a good one.

Public speaking is one of (if not, the) most important skills to harness as a young person. Schools should prioritize this more.

It is less important to try a wide variety of things to find your interest than it is to try one thing, and commit to it deeply. You can always easily try things haphazardly. Depth requires patience, discomfort and resilience. These insights can only emerge from sustained effort, and are ones that actually help you understand what matter to you. In simpler terms: interest follows investment, not the other way around.

If within your means, moving out for university is a great idea.

What you choose to do in high school, how you do them, and why - have profound impacts on your future. This is not to say not doing things in high school is bad. This is to say doing things in high school is a great idea.

It is hard to write well. Moreover, even if you think you can write well, an important trait is to constantly try to write better. See more [here](https://paulgraham.com/goodwriting.html).

Leadership is inseparable from empathy. You cannot lead a group of people without first understanding what it is like to be in their shoes (with genuine curiosity, and interest). 

Showing up is an extremely underrated mechanism for achieving anything. If you are lost, start by showing up and trying something.
