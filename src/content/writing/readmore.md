Since January 2024, I have read 31 books. I don’t say this because I think it means anything (reading books is not a competition) - but rather to demonstrate progress, as before that point - I was unable to get to nearly that number. 

Here are some tips that helped me read more. 

Tip 1: Read what you enjoy.

There is no point in reading books if you don’t enjoy them. In-fact, reading ones you don’t enjoy is a sure-fire way to diminish, quickly, any possible interest you may have developed in reading. Don’t fall into the trap that if a book is not a “classic” that somehow it presents less value. 

Something that I think warrants a totally separate discussion entirely is that the inherent value you acquire from reading is independent of what you read. Much of the value I acquired from reading was the ability to focus for long periods of time on one task, an improvement in my writing and vocabulary - and overall mental clarity or escape as a way to take a break. None of these things depend on you reading a book that is a classic (in-fact, you may acquire a lot of value from reading a book that is maybe not well presented, as to be able to better understand how to write clearer). 

Regardless, read books that you enjoy on topics that are important to you - that way you finish. My only recommendation here would be to make sure you routinely alternate between fiction and non-fiction books. Otherwise, you may develop a sort of “fatigue” to a certain one. I’m currently going through this with fiction, where I’ve read maybe the past 5 or so books in the category and it’s quite hard to see myself going back in the near future. 

A final point I’d make here is that reading what you enjoy is a great way to build up to more classic literature. Diving right into a tough, but classic, book may present you with a lot of frustration and confusion if it’s your first time. This may discourage you from ever going back to these types of books. It is not a reflection on you as a reader that this is the case, rather - reading a good variety of books across many genres allows you to build a sort of foundation before you enter complex territory. Classics are great reads when you are able to ease into them.

Tip 2: Don’t read on your phone.

I used to do this a lot, and sometimes still do - but it is not nearly as valuable as I think it once was. It probably was attributed to the less accessible nature of short form content, which is in almost every app now. This makes it far too easy to switch apps immediately. My suggestion here would honestly be to go and support your local library. 

Waiting in line for books is annoying, but I think it’s a much more long-term approach to reading that will retain your focus when doing so. Buying books also works, but for the frequency that I read at it’s not the best option. Plus, supporting your library is an absolutely pivotal thing - they provide a heap of resources. 

The only issue that I sometime encounter that really deters me is when the library does not have a book that I’d like to read. However, most systems have a way to request, and I can personally attest that I’ve done so and gotten said book into my hands in under 5 months. A very quick process, if you think about what is involved in it. 

Tip 3: Set aside a dedicated time to read. 

This one is much easier said than done, but my tip here is to try to not make it before bed. I used to do this but found it was much easier to go from studying to sleeping as opposed to studying to reading. It’s instead I found it a a much better idea to read when you’re having a meal, or at a specific time when you’re taking a break from some work. This way you’re not feeling like it’s the last thing to do in the day.
