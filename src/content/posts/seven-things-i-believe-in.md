I've seen lots of posts from people, much farther along in life than me, detail a set of things that they believe in. I've always strayed away from publishing one of my own, primarily because I find myself possibly being too young to have beliefs that I can concretely say I will always follow.

Maybe all of these beliefs will change, maybe a few, maybe none; but from the 17 years I've been on this earth: here are some things I believe in.

1. Be, unapologetically, kind.  
2. Working a lot â‰  working smart. However, working smart can (and often does) require you to work a lot.  
3. Being a charismatic person is an amazing & important aspiration to have.  
4. Never be in the absence of learning.  
5. Reading of all kinds, but specifically books, is something time has to be made for.  
6. Surround yourself with people you aspire to be like.  
7. Never let go of humility and humbleness. (By extension, always be willing to seek knowledge from people around you.)
